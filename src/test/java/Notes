    What is Git?
           Git is a version control tool

    What is a local repository?
        A local repository is a storage on our computer

    What is a remote repository?
       github

    Architecture of git:

    When it comes to the arcitecture of git there are three stages which are

    Working Directory

    Staging Area

    Repository



    Working Directory= I must know the path of where the project is located

        gitproject1 --> pom, src, target, .idea

        5.where should u create your local git repository?
        ideally you should create you repo inside your working directory i.e in this case gitProject1
        Note:
        One repo for one single project
        No subRepos are advised
        ----------------------------------Tracking your first project using git----------------------
        1.Decide the location where to create the repository and navigate my MR terminal to that particular directory
        2.intitalize an empty repository  git init---> to initalize an empty repository
        to delete a repo, simply delete the .git folder
        3.git status--> shows u untacked files in red color
                    --> shows u the tracked files ingreen color
        4.git add . --> moves all the files to the staging area ..
        5. git commit -m "commit message" --> sends all the files from the staging area to the local repo
        6. git status after the commit shows working tree clean  becuase  we have
           all the threee stages i.e working directory , staging area and local repo synchronised



   Where should I create my local git repository?
    Don't create it in the src folder.

    *** I MUST CREATE IT IN gitproject1 (the working directory of the project)***

    Note:
    One repo for one single project
    No subRepos are advised


    ----------Tracking my first project using git------------------

    we will create a maven project

    Preforming a commit

   1. Decide on a location that I want to create a repository and navigate my MR terminal to
   that particular directory
   2. Initiate an empty repository


   1. Decide on a location that I want to create a repository and navigate my MR terminal to
   that particular directory
Method one:

   open gitbash
    pwd to find current location
        ls to open avialable folders
            cd (then select name of folder) ( in this case IdeaProjects then Git)
                pwd to make sure I selected the correct folder


Method two:

   I can right click the project and open in explorer
    This will open the location of your project
        with this I can right click on the project and click on gitbash here

  2. Initiate an empty repository
        pwd
            git init

  git init creates a .git folder in the project folder

  now the first step with git init is that everything is sent to the working directory. In the working directory
  the code is not in the repository. meaning its not backed up.

  next I have to see the status of the git by typing

  git status

  if files are red that means the files are untracked
  Tracked files show up green

    git add .

  What this does is it moves the folders to the staging area. ( a snapshot/ picture of the files)

  we type
    git status
        which should show files in green meaning the files are tracked

So now that have the files we want in the staging area and we're sure these are the files we want
to commit, then we can commit( make sure to label the commits properly)
 To commit we type

    git commit -m "the uniue name of the commit"

    Commit name example
        git commit -m "temperature check basic code is there in the repo"

After git commit
    the files are moved from the staging area to the local repository

To delete git just delete the folder

-----------------------------

New git topics

    New git commands
        If I learn them it will make my life easier and help debugging code.

To view the files in my staging area

        git ls-files

to remove any file from the staging area

        git rm --cached filename

What is
     git restore .

** Remember this command***
    Any updates in git lead to red untracked files when typing git status

to show all updates made in my code or notes I can type

git diff

with this gitbash will generate all modified updates

press ! to get out of the get diff or control c

 -------------- the git ignore file--------

This file must be ignored and not added to the repository

1. Create a .gitignore file by typing
    touch .gitignore = creates a .gitignore file // in your project

        then enter the name of the file like below
            touch .gitignore "NOMNOM"

            This should show the NOMNOM file as an untracked file(red) like below
            Untracked files:
              (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
             .gitignore // this is located in my project folder under .git
              NOMNOM

 an easier method to ignore multiple file
    Any files I want to ignore all I have to do is type the name of the file in the .gitignore text file
        open text and manually type the names of each file I want to ignore
